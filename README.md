# Hey, I'm Joris 👋

I'm building **AgentSats** – an open-source, non-custodial governance layer for
Bitcoin/Lightning payments by AI agents.

- 🧠 Focus: AI agents, Bitcoin/Lightning, API economy, machine-to-machine payments
- 🛠️ I like working on: SDKs, governance layers, developer tooling
- 🎓 M.A. Business Innovation & Technology (HSBI), combining business & deep tech

## What I'm working on now

### AgentSats – Agent Wallet Governance Layer

`AgentSats` is a framework that sits between **AI agents** and **Bitcoin/Lightning
infrastructure**:

- SDK for agents (e.g. `pay_if_required()`, `pay_invoice()`, `get_balance()`)
- Policies for budgets, limits, allowed targets and human-in-the-loop rules
- Non-custodial: keys & funds stay with the user/organisation
- Designed for agentic workflows, Pay-per-API and machine payments

> Status: early-stage / exploration. Expect rapid iteration and breaking changes.

## Selected past projects

- `taskflow-ai` – personal task manager that combines the simplicity of a to-do list with the power of AI
- `survey-nft` – NFT-based survey frontend to interact with core contracts (Web3)

## Interests & direction

- Agentic architectures (LLM agents, tool orchestration, workflows)
- Bitcoin & Lightning as infrastructure for machine payments
- Governance & observability for autonomous systems (limits, audit, policies)
- Turning research ideas into running code & real-world prototypes
